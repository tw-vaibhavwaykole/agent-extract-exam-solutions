Question 2
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part A (Short Notes - 20 Marks)**
Question (4 marks):
Coercion

Answer:
**Answer: Coercion:**

**Definition and Concept:**
Coercion is a key element of a valid contract and refers to the use of physical force or threats to induce a person into entering into a contract. As per Section 15 of the Indian Contract Act, coercion is defined as "committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code or unlawful detention of any property to the prejudice of any person, with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement". It essentially means the use of unlawful or improper pressure to obtain the consent of a party to a contract.

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. Coercion v/s Undue Influence: While coercion refers to the use of force or threats, undue influence refers to the use of mental pressure to obtain consent. Coercion is a criminal offence under the Indian Penal Code, whereas undue influence is a civil wrong.
2. Voidable Contract: A contract induced by coercion is voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained by coercion. The affected party can either choose to affirm the contract or rescind it.
3. Absence of Free Consent: Coercion is considered as one of the forms of lack of free consent, which is essential for a valid contract. Therefore, a contract entered into under coercion is not considered legally binding.
4. Burden of Proof: It is the responsibility of the affected party to prove that they were coerced into entering into a contract. The burden of proof lies on them to show that they did not give their consent voluntarily.
5. Not Applicable to Third Parties: The doctrine of coercion only applies to the parties who are directly involved in the contract and not to third parties.

**At Least One Relevant Case Law:**
An important case that deals with the concept of coercion is Raghunath Prasad v. Sarju Prasad (1924) Cal. The court held that the threat of criminal prosecution against a party to a contract amounts to coercion and renders the contract voidable.

**Conclusion:**
Coercion is a fundamental concept in the law of contracts and is essential to ensure that parties enter into a contract voluntarily. It is important for parties to be aware of the principles and features of coercion to avoid being coerced into entering into a contract against their will. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides for remedies for contracts induced by coercion, ensuring fair and just outcomes for parties involved.

Question 4
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part A (Short Notes - 20 Marks)**
Question (4 marks):
Contingent contract

Answer:
**Answer: Contingent contract**

A. Short Notes (marks <= 5):
Word count: 150-200 words

Definition and Concept (20%):
A contingent contract is an agreement between parties where the performance of one or both parties is dependent on the occurrence of a specific event in the future. This event may be uncertain or may not happen at all. In such contracts, the rights and obligations of the parties are conditional and dependent on the happening or non-happening of the event.

Key Principles and Features (50%):
1. Contingency: The performance of a contingent contract is dependent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event.
2. Uncertainty: The event on which the contract is contingent must be uncertain.
3. Mutual Consent: Both parties must agree to the terms of the contract with regard to the contingent event.
4. Legal enforceability: A contingent contract is legally enforceable only if the contingent event takes place.
5. Time limit: The contingent event must be likely to occur within a reasonable time frame.

At Least One Relevant Case Law (15%):
Ram Coomar Coondoo vs Chunder Canto Mookerjee (1876) Cal HC - In this case, the court held that a contract cannot be contingent on an impossible event or an event that is deemed impossible in the eyes of law.

Conclusion (15% - must summarize key points):
In conclusion, a contingent contract is a type of contract that involves the performance of one or both parties being dependent on the occurrence of an uncertain event in the future. It is essential for both parties to agree to the terms of the contract and for the contingent event to be likely to occur within a reasonable time frame for the contract to be legally enforceable.
