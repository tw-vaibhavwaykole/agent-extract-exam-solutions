Question 2
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part A (Short Notes - 20 Marks)**
Question (4 marks):
Coercion

Answer:
**Answer: Coercion**

Definition and Concept:
Coercion is the use of force or threats to compel someone to do something against their will. In the Indian Contract Act, 1872, coercion is defined under section 15 as "committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or the unlawful detention of any property, to induce a person to enter into a contract."

Key Principles and Features:
1. Coercion v/s Undue Influence: Unlike undue influence, coercion involves physical force or threats, whereas undue influence involves mental pressure. Coercion is also a criminal offence under the IPC, while undue influence is a civil wrong.
2. Voidable Contract: A contract entered into under coercion is voidable at the option of the party whose consent was obtained by coercion.
3. Burden of Proof: The burden of proving coercion lies on the party alleging it. The courts require strong and convincing evidence to prove coercion.
4. Consent: Coercion vitiates consent, which is an essential element of a valid contract. If consent is not freely given, the contract is not binding.
5. Public Policy: Coercion is against public policy as it violates the principle of free will and is considered morally wrong.

Relevant Case Law:
In the case of Bishandas v. Ramsarup (1978) Rajasthan High Court, the court held that the threat to file a criminal complaint against the other party's brother amounted to coercion, and the contract was voidable at the option of the coerced party.

Conclusion:
Coercion is a serious offence in the eyes of the law and is considered a major factor in rendering a contract voidable. It is important to understand the difference between coercion and undue influence in order to determine the validity of a contract. The burden of proof is on the party alleging coercion, and strong evidence is required to prove it. Coercion goes against the principle of free will and is against public policy.

Question (4 marks):
Stifling Prosecution (Stifling)

Answer:
**Answer:**

Definition and Concept:
Stifling Prosecution is a legal doctrine that prevents the abuse of legal process by prohibiting the prosecution of a person for the same offense more than once. It is also known as the principle of "autrefois acquit" or "autrefois convict" in common law.

Key Principles and Features:

2. Finality of Judgment: This doctrine upholds the finality of a court's decision and prevents the same matter from being litigated repeatedly.
3. Protection against Harassment: Stifling Prosecution protects individuals from being subjected to repeated prosecution, which may lead to harassment and oppression.
4. Limited Exceptions: This principle has certain exceptions, such as when there is new evidence or if the first trial was not conducted fairly.

At Least One Relevant Case Law:
In the case of Kolla Veera Raghav Rao v. Gorantla Venkateswara Rao (2011) Supreme Court, the accused was charged with murder and acquitted by the trial court. The prosecution filed an appeal, but it was dismissed. The accused was then charged with the same murder again, and the Supreme Court held that this was a clear case of stifling prosecution and violated the principle of double jeopardy.

Conclusion:
Stifling Prosecution is an essential principle of the Indian legal system, and it aims to protect individuals from being subjected to repeated prosecution. It upholds the finality of a court's decision and prevents abuse of legal process.

Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part A (Short Notes - 20 Marks)**
Question (4 marks):
Contingent contract

Answer:
**Answer:**

**Definition and Concept:**
A contingent contract is a type of contract where the performance of one or more parties is dependent on the occurrence of a future uncertain event. It means that the contract will only be enforced if the specified event happens or does not happen. The future event must be uncertain, and it must be related to the contract. A contingent contract is different from a conditional contract, where the performance is based on the fulfilment of a pre-existing condition.

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. Uncertainty of Future Event: A contingent contract is based on the uncertainty of a future event. The event must be uncertain and not a certain or probable occurrence.
2. Performance Depends on Event: The performance of the contract is dependent on the occurrence of the specified event. If the event does not occur, the contract becomes void.
3. Contingent Event Must Be Related to Contract: The contingent event must be related to the contract. It cannot be a random or unrelated event.
4. Contract Becomes Enforceable on Happening of Event: The contract becomes enforceable only when the specified event happens or does not happen. Until then, it remains a contingent contract.
5. Contingent Contract can be Implied or Express: A contingent contract can be either implied or express. In an implied contract, the conditions are not explicitly stated but are understood by the parties.

**At Least One Relevant Case Law:**
Sudershan Trading Co. v. Govindram Bros. Pvt. Ltd. (1967) Supreme Court of India - In this case, the court held that a contract of sale was contingent upon the happening of a certain event. If the event did not occur, the contract would become void. The court also stated that if the event was not a condition precedent, the contract would become voidable at the option of the party whose performance was contingent on the happening of the event.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, a contingent contract is a type of contract where the performance of one or more parties is dependent on the occurrence of a future uncertain event. The key principles and features of a contingent contract must be understood to avoid any disputes or misunderstandings regarding the enforceability of the contract. The case law mentioned above also provides a clear understanding of the concept of contingent contracts.

Answer:
**Answer:**

Restitution is a legal remedy available in cases where one party has unjustly benefited at the expense of another. It is a form of compensation to restore the unjust enrichment of the party who has suffered a loss or injury. In contract law, restitution is an important principle as it aims to restore parties to their original position before the contract was formed.

3. Restoration of original position: The main aim of restitution is to restore the aggrieved party to their original position before the unjust enrichment occurred. This can be in the form of returning the benefit received or compensating for the value of the benefit.

4. No fault requirement: Restitution can be awarded even if the party receiving the benefit did not have any intention to do so. The focus is on the unjust enrichment, not the intention of the parties.

**Relevant Case Law:**

Sailaja Rani v. K. Srinivas (2003) Supreme Court of India - In this case, the defendant sold a property to the plaintiff without disclosing that it was leased to a third party. The plaintiff sued for restitution on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation.

Question 7
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
"In quasi-contract, the promise to pay is implied by Law and is not issued on any express agreement. Explain with examples."

Answer:
**Answer:**

Quasi-contracts, also known as implied-in-law contracts, are agreements enforced by law to prevent unjust enrichment or loss to any party involved. It is a legal fiction used to prevent unjust enrichment or unjust suffering. These contracts are not based on any actual agreement between the parties, but rather are imposed by the law to ensure fairness and prevent undue advantage to any party.

**Definition and Concept:**
A quasi-contract is a contract implied by law, even though there is no actual agreement between the parties. It arises when one party receives a benefit from another, and it would be unjust to allow the receiving party to keep the benefit without paying for it. The law, therefore, imposes an obligation on the receiving party to pay for the benefit received, even if there was no intent to enter into a contract.

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. No actual agreement: Unlike a traditional contract, a quasi-contract does not require an offer, acceptance, or consideration. The promise to pay is implied by law.
2. Implied by law: The existence of a quasi-contract is determined by the law, and not based on the parties' intention to create a contract.
3. Unjust enrichment: Quasi-contracts are designed to prevent one party from being unjustly enriched at the expense of another.
4. No fault required: Quasi-contracts can arise even in cases where one party is not at fault. It is based on the principle of equity and fair dealing.
5. No remedy of damages: Unlike traditional contracts, where damages can be claimed for breach, in quasi-contracts, the remedy is restitution, i.e., the return of the benefit received.

**At Least One Relevant Case Law:**
In the case of Moses v. Macferlan (1760) 2 Burr 1005, the defendant had agreed to sell goods to the plaintiff. However, before the goods were delivered, the defendant sold them to a third party. The plaintiff sued for breach of contract, but the court held that there was never a valid contract between the parties. However, the court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff for the goods received based on the principle of unjust enrichment.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, quasi-contracts are legal remedies used to prevent one party from being unjustly enriched at the expense of another. It is based on the principle of equity and fair dealing, and the promise to pay is implied by law. These contracts serve as a means to ensure fairness and prevent undue advantage in situations where there is no actual agreement between the parties.

Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
What are the various ways in which a contract may be discharged?

Answer:
**Answer:**

Introduction:
Contracts are legally binding agreements between two or more parties that create obligations to perform certain actions. However, there are various ways in which a contract may come to an end or be discharged. These ways are governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872. In this answer, we will discuss the various ways in which a contract may be discharged.

Main Content:
1. Performance: A contract may be discharged when both parties fulfill their obligations under the contract. This is known as performance and it is the most common way in which contracts are discharged.

2. Agreement: A contract may also be discharged by mutual agreement between the parties to terminate the contract. This can be done through a novation, where a new contract is created to replace the old one, or through a rescission, where the original contract is cancelled.

3. Impossibility of Performance: When the performance of a contract becomes impossible due to unforeseen events or circumstances, the contract is discharged. This is known as impossibility of performance and can be further classified into two types: physical impossibility and legal impossibility.

4. Operation of Law: A contract may be discharged by operation of law, which means that the contract is terminated due to the operation of a law or statute. This includes cases where the contract is declared void or illegal.

5. Lapse of Time: If a contract has a specific time period for performance and that time period expires, the contract is discharged. This is known as the lapse of time and it releases both parties from their obligations under the contract.

6. Breach of Contract: When one party fails to fulfill their obligations under the contract, it is known as a breach of contract. This can lead to the discharge of the contract and the party at fault may be liable for damages.

7. Doctrine of Frustration: When a contract becomes impossible to perform due to an unforeseen event or change of circumstances that is beyond the control of either party, it is known as the doctrine of frustration. This can discharge the contract and release both parties from their obligations.

Relevant Case Laws:
1. Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur & Co. (1954) Supreme Court: In this case, the court held that when a contract becomes impossible to perform due to a change in the law, it is considered as a discharge by operation of law.

2. Taylor v. Caldwell (1863) Court of Queen's Bench: In this case, the court held that when the performance of a contract becomes impossible due to an unforeseen event, the contract is discharged by frustration.

Current Legal Position:
The Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides for the various ways in which a contract may be discharged. However, there is no specific provision for the doctrine of frustration in the Act. The current legal position is that the doctrine of frustration is recognized in India and is applied in cases where the performance of a contract becomes impossible due to unforeseen events.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, a contract may be discharged through various ways including performance, mutual agreement, impossibility of performance, operation of law, lapse of time, breach of contract, and the doctrine of frustration. It is important for parties to understand these ways of discharge to avoid any legal disputes in the future.

Question 9
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
What are the rules relating to time and place of performance of an Act?

Answer:
**Answer:**

Introduction:
The Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays down the rules and regulations regarding the performance of a contract. Time and place of performance of an act is an essential aspect of a contract and failure to adhere to these rules can lead to a breach of contract. In this essay, we will discuss the rules relating to time and place of performance of an act under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

Main Content:
1. Definition and Concept:
The time and place of performance of an act refers to the time and place at which the parties to a contract are obligated to fulfill their respective promises. It is an essential aspect of a contract as it determines when and where the promises made by the parties must be fulfilled.

2. Key Principles and Features:
a. Time of Performance: According to Section 46 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, if a contract does not specify the time for performance, then the promise must be performed within a reasonable time. What constitutes a reasonable time depends on the nature of the contract, the custom of the trade, and the intention of the parties.

b. Place of Performance: As per Section 47 of the Act, unless the contract expressly or impliedly mentions otherwise, the promisee is bound to accept performance at any reasonable place. However, if the contract specifies a particular place, then the promise must be performed at that place only.

c. Simultaneous Performance: In cases where the parties are obligated to perform their promises simultaneously, then the performance must take place at the same time and place.

d. Effect of Delay in Performance: If a party fails to perform their promise within the specified time or within a reasonable time, the other party may either terminate the contract or waive the delay and continue with the contract. In case of termination, the party in default may be liable for damages.

3. Relevant Case Laws:
a. Bhagwandas Goverdhandas Kedia v. Girdharilal Parshottamdas (1966) SC: In this case, the Supreme Court held that if the terms of the contract do not specify the time of performance, then the performance must take place within a reasonable time.

b. Laxmi Devi v. Shri Ram (1966) All. HC: In this case, the Allahabad High Court held that if the contract specifies a particular place of performance, then the promise must be performed at that place only.

Critical Analysis:
The rules relating to time and place of performance of an act are essential to ensure that the parties fulfill their contractual obligations. It allows for smooth and timely execution of the contract and prevents any disputes arising from the delay or failure to perform. However, there may be instances where the specified time or place of performance may become impractical due to unforeseen circumstances. In such cases, the courts may use their discretion to determine what is a reasonable time or place of performance.

Current Legal Position:
The rules relating to time and place of performance of an act are still applicable under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. However, with the advancement of technology and the increase in international trade, there have been developments in this area of law. The courts have now started to consider factors such as the mode of communication, place of business, and the intention of the parties to determine the time and place of performance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, time and place of performance of an act are crucial aspects of a contract. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays down clear rules and principles regarding the same, and these must be followed to avoid any disputes. The courts have also played a significant role in interpreting and developing this area of law to suit the changing times and needs of the parties.

Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
What is the object and nature of Law of Contract?

Answer:
**Answer:**
The Law of Contract is a fundamental aspect of legal studies and is an essential subject for law students in India. It is a branch of civil law that governs the creation, validity, performance, and termination of agreements between parties. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable obligations. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 is the primary legislation governing contracts in India.

**Introduction:**
The Law of Contract deals with the rules and regulations that govern the formation and enforcement of contracts. It is an essential aspect of business law and is crucial for understanding commercial transactions. The nature of the law of contract is based on the principle of freedom of contract, where parties have the autonomy to enter into agreements based on their own free will.

**Main Content:**
The main objective of the Law of Contract is to ensure that promises made by parties are legally binding and enforceable. It provides a legal framework for individuals and businesses to enter into agreements and protects their rights and interests. The following are the key principles and features of the Law of Contract in India:

1. Agreement: An agreement is the first essential element of a contract. It is a meeting of minds between two or more parties with the intention to create legal relations.
2. Offer and Acceptance: An offer is a proposal made by one party to another, and the acceptance of that offer creates a binding contract. The acceptance must be unconditional, unambiguous, and communicated to the offeror.
3. Consideration: Consideration is the price paid for a promise and is an essential element of a valid contract. It can be in the form of money, goods, or services.
4. Capacity to Contract: For a contract to be legally enforceable, the parties must have the legal capacity to enter into an agreement. Minors, persons of unsound mind, and those disqualified by law cannot enter into a valid contract.

However, there are certain limitations, such as the doctrine of privity of contract, which restricts the enforcement of contracts by third parties.

**Current Legal Position:**
The Indian Contract Act, 1872 has been amended several times to keep up with the changing business practices and advancements in technology. The recent changes include the introduction of e-contracts and electronic signatures, making the law more adaptable to the modern business world.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the Law of Contract is the cornerstone of commercial law and is crucial for understanding the legal aspects of agreements. It provides a legal framework for parties to enter into agreements and ensures that their rights and interests are protected.

Question 11
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
What is an offer? When is it completed? State the rules of a valid offer.

Answer:
**Answer:**
An offer is an essential element of a contract, which is an expression of willingness to enter into a legally binding agreement on certain terms, made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines an offer as “when one person signifies to another his willingness to do or abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence.”

An offer is completed when it is communicated to the offeree, and the offeree has the knowledge of the offer. An offer may be made to a specific person or a group of persons. It can be made orally, in writing or even through conduct. An offer must be distinguished from an invitation to offer, which is merely an invitation to make an offer and not an actual offer. An invitation to offer is not binding and cannot be accepted to form a contract.

The rules for a valid offer are as follows:

1. Intention to create legal relations: The offeror must have the intention to enter into a legally binding agreement, and the offer must be made with this intention.

2. Communication of offer: The offer must be communicated to the offeree in order for it to be valid. An offer made to a wrong person or in a wrong manner is not valid.

3. Certainty: The terms of the offer must be clear, specific and certain. An offer cannot be vague or ambiguous, as it would lead to uncertainty and confusion.

4. Acceptance must be possible: The offer must be capable of being accepted. An offer that is impossible to accept, such as an offer to do an illegal act, is not a valid offer.

5. Revocation: An offer can be revoked at any time before it is accepted, unless it is an offer for a unilateral contract, which cannot be revoked once performance has begun.

6. Communication of acceptance: The acceptance of the offer must be communicated to the offeror. If the offeror specifies a mode of communication, then acceptance must be communicated in that manner.

7. Lapse of time: An offer lapses after a reasonable time if it is not accepted. The time for acceptance may also be specified in the offer, and if the offer is not accepted within that time, it will lapse.

8. Termination by rejection: An offer is terminated when it is rejected by the offeree. A counter-offer is a rejection of the original offer and amounts to a new offer.

9. Termination by death or insanity: An offer is terminated if either the offeror or the offeree dies or becomes insane before the offer is accepted.

10. Acceptance must be unconditional: Acceptance of the offer must be unconditional and must be in accordance with the terms of the offer.

11. Offer must be made with the intention to obtain acceptance: An offer must be made with the intention that it shall become binding as soon as it is accepted by the offeree.

Case Law: Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt (1913) 40 IA 489 SC
In this case, the defendant offered a reward for anyone who could find his missing nephew. The plaintiff, who was unaware of the offer, found the nephew and demanded the reward from the defendant. The court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to the reward as he had no knowledge of the offer and therefore could not have accepted it.

---

In conclusion, an offer is a crucial element of a contract, and it must be valid and properly communicated in order to be accepted and form a contract. The rules of a valid offer aim to ensure that the offer is genuine and capable of leading to a binding agreement. A failure to comply with these rules may result in the offer being invalid and unenforceable.

**Main Content:**
- **Definition and Concept:**
Necessaries are defined as goods or services that are suitable to the condition in life of the minor and to his actual requirements at the time of the contract. These goods or services must be necessary for the minor's support and maintenance. The term 'necessary' is not limited to basic needs but also includes goods or services that are essential for the minor's proper education, training, or for his lawful profession.

- **At Least One Relevant Case Law:**
In the case of Mohori Bibee v. Dharmodas Ghose (1903) Privy Council, it was held that a minor is not liable for the repayment of the money borrowed for the purchase of land as it was not considered a necessary for his support and maintenance. However, in the case of Hart v. O'Connor (1985) Delhi High Court, it was held that the minor was liable for the payment of the money borrowed for the purchase of textbooks as it was considered a necessary for his education.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, necessaries are those goods or services that are necessary for the minor's support and maintenance. A minor can be held liable for a contract for necessaries only if the goods or services are suitable to his condition in life and if he has no other means to obtain them. It is important to note that the minor's liability for necessaries is limited to the reasonable price of the goods or services and not the entire contract amount.

**Types of Injunctions:**
1. Temporary Injunction: It is granted during the pendency of the legal proceedings to maintain the status quo until the final judgement is passed. It is also known as an interim injunction and is granted to prevent immediate and irreparable harm.

2. Permanent Injunction: It is granted after the final judgement and is a permanent order prohibiting a party from doing a certain act or requiring them to perform a certain act. It is granted when there is a violation of a legal right and the only way to remedy the situation is by granting a permanent injunction.

3. Mandatory Injunction: It is granted when the court directs a party to perform a certain act. It is usually granted in cases of breach of contract or when specific performance of a contract is required. The court may award damages along with a mandatory injunction.

4. Prohibitory Injunction: It is granted when the court directs a party to refrain from doing a certain act. It is usually granted in cases where there is a threat of irreparable harm or damage.

**Relevant Case Laws:**
1. Ram Chandra v. Jagdish Prasad (1976) Delhi High Court: In this case, the court granted a temporary injunction to stop the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff's possession of the property until the final judgement was passed.

2. Ramanuj Pratap Singh v. Smt. Kusum Lata (1990) Supreme Court: In this case, the court granted a permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from constructing a building on the plaintiff's land as it would cause irreparable harm to the plaintiff's right to enjoy the property.

**Critical Analysis:**
Injunctions are an important remedy in contract law as they protect the rights of parties and prevent any harm or damage. However, there have been instances where injunctions have been misused by parties to delay the legal process or to gain an unfair advantage. Therefore, courts are cautious in granting injunctions and ensure that there is a valid reason for granting the same.

**Current Legal Position:**
The law related to injunctions in India is well established and governed by the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The courts have the power to grant both temporary and permanent injunctions to protect the rights of parties. However, with the increasing number of cases and backlog of cases, the process of obtaining an injunction has become time-consuming.

**Conclusion:**
Injunctions are an important remedy available in contract law to prevent injustice and to safeguard the rights of parties. The Specific Relief Act, 1963, provides for various types of injunctions that can be granted by the court. However, it is important to ensure that injunctions are not misused and are granted only when there is a valid reason to do so.

Question 14
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part A (Short Notes - 20 Marks)**
Question (4 marks):
Foreign Sovereign

Answer:
**Answer:**

Foreign Sovereign:

- Definition and Concept:
Foreign Sovereign refers to a state or government that is recognized by other states as having independent authority over a particular territory and its inhabitants. It is a term used in international law to describe the legal status of a state in relation to other states. This concept is based on the principle of sovereign equality, which means that no state has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another state.

- Key Principles and Features:
1. Immunity from jurisdiction: One of the key principles of foreign sovereign is immunity from jurisdiction. This means that a foreign sovereign cannot be sued in the courts of another state without its consent. This is based on the principle of sovereign immunity, which protects states from being subject to the laws of another state.
2. Limited exceptions to immunity: There are certain exceptions to immunity from jurisdiction, such as commercial activities, tortious acts, and waiver of immunity by the foreign sovereign.
3. No enforcement of judgments: Foreign sovereigns are also immune from the enforcement of judgments against them. This means that even if a court in one state rules in favor of a claim against a foreign sovereign, the judgment cannot be enforced against the assets of the foreign sovereign.
4. Sovereign debt: Foreign sovereigns are also protected from lawsuits related to sovereign debt. This means that creditors cannot sue a foreign sovereign for repayment of loans or bonds issued by the state.

- Relevant Case Law:
Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino (1964) US Supreme Court - In this case, the court recognized the principle of sovereign immunity and held that the act of state doctrine prevented the US courts from reviewing the validity of a taking of property by a foreign sovereign within its own territory.

- Conclusion:
In conclusion, foreign sovereign refers to the legal status of a state in relation to other states, based on the principle of sovereign equality. It is characterized by immunity from jurisdiction, limited exceptions to immunity, no enforcement of judgments, and protection from lawsuits related to sovereign debt. The case of Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino is a relevant case that established the principle of sovereign immunity.

Section: **Part A (Short Notes - 20 Marks)**
Question (4 marks):
Undue Influence

Answer:
**Answer:**

Undue Influence:

Definition and Concept:
Undue influence is a legal principle that refers to any situation where one party takes advantage of a position of power or trust over another party to unfairly influence their decision-making. This can occur in contract law when one party exerts pressure or influence over the other party to enter into a contract.

Key Principles and Features:
1. Relationship of Trust: The key element of undue influence is the existence of a relationship of trust between the parties. This can be a fiduciary relationship, such as between a doctor and patient, or a relationship of confidence, such as between a parent and child.

2. Dominant Position: The party exerting undue influence must be in a dominant position, where they have the ability to influence the decision of the other party.

3. Unfair Advantage: The influence exerted must be unfair and take advantage of the trust relationship between the parties.

4. Presumption of Undue Influence: In certain relationships, such as between a parent and child, there is a presumption of undue influence, and the burden of proof shifts to the dominant party to show that the contract was entered into freely and voluntarily.

Relevant Case Law:
In the case of Brij Mohan v. Smt. Prem Lata (1996) Supreme Court, the court held that a transaction can be set aside on the ground of undue influence if the following conditions are met:
1. The party exerting the influence is in a dominant position.
2. The transaction is unconscionable, oppressive, or lacking in free consent.
3. The dominant party has taken unfair advantage of the relationship between the parties.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, undue influence is a principle in contract law that protects parties from being unfairly influenced to enter into a contract. It is important for parties to be aware of this concept and seek legal advice if they believe they have been unduly influenced in a contract. The case law mentioned above provides a clear example of when undue influence can be established in a court of law.

Question (4 marks):
Service Combination

Answer:
**Answer:** Service Combination

Definition and Concept:
Service combination refers to the combination of various services that are provided together as a package deal by a service provider to a consumer. It involves the bundling of different services, which may be complementary or interdependent, and offering them as a single product to the consumer.

Key Principles and Features:
1. Contractual relationship: Service combination involves a contractual relationship between the service provider and the consumer, where the service provider agrees to provide a combination of services and the consumer agrees to pay for the same.

2. Consideration: There must be a valid consideration for the service combination, which is usually paid by the consumer in the form of a single package price.

3. Essential terms: The essential terms of the service combination, such as the nature of services, price, duration, and payment terms, must be clearly defined in the contract.

4. Obligations of parties: The service provider is obligated to provide all the services included in the combination as per the agreed terms, while the consumer is obligated to pay the agreed price for the services.

5. Performance of services: The services included in the combination must be performed with due care and skill, and must meet the standards of quality as agreed upon in the contract.

Relevant Case Law:
In the case of Reliance Communications Limited v. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (2008) Supreme Court, it was held that service combination is a valid and enforceable contract, and the service provider is liable for any deficiency in the performance of services.

Conclusion:
Service combination has become a common practice in the service industry, as it offers convenience and cost savings to the consumers. However, it is essential for both the service provider and the consumer to understand the terms and conditions of the contract before entering into a service combination. Any breach of contract can lead to legal consequences for the defaulting party.

Question (4 marks):
Champerty

Answer:
**Answer:**
Champerty refers to an unlawful agreement between a party not involved in a legal case and the plaintiff, where the former agrees to finance the litigation in exchange for a share in the proceeds of the case. This practice is prohibited in India under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. 

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. Champerty is considered a form of maintenance, which is the unlawful support and encouragement of one party in a legal case by a third party.
2. It is based on the principle that parties should not be allowed to profit from litigation and encourages frivolous lawsuits.
3. Champerty is a criminal offence under Section 209 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
4. Any agreement that is champertous is considered void under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
5. The agreement must be for a share in the proceeds of the case in order to be considered champertous.

**Relevant Case Law:**
The case of Manilal Mohanlal Shah v. Harsukhlal Dahyabhai (1969) Gujarat High Court, dealt with the issue of champerty and maintenance. The court held that an agreement to finance litigation in exchange for a share in the proceeds of the case is against public policy and is therefore void.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, champerty is an unlawful practice that is prohibited under Indian law. Any agreement that involves a party financing a legal case in exchange for a share in the proceeds of the case is considered champertous and is void. This principle aims to ensure that parties do not profit from litigation and encourages the resolution of disputes through legitimate means.

Question (4 marks):
Tender

Answer:
**Answer: Tender**

Definition and Concept:
A tender is a formal document issued by a party (known as the tenderer) to invite bids from other parties (known as the bidders) for a specific project or work. It is a crucial step in the process of entering into a contract, as it allows the tenderer to compare and select the best offer that meets their requirements.

Key Principles and Features:

2. Open Competition: The tendering process must be fair, transparent, and open to all eligible bidders. It ensures that the tenderer receives competitive bids and selects the most suitable offer.

3. Bidding Documents: The tender documents must be comprehensive and provide all the necessary information for the bidders to submit their bids accurately.

4. Eligibility Criteria: The tenderer may specify certain eligibility criteria, such as financial stability, technical expertise, and experience, to ensure that only qualified bidders participate in the process.

5. Evaluation of Bids: The tenderer evaluates the bids based on various factors, such as price, quality, and delivery time, and selects the bid that best meets their requirements.

6. Confidentiality: The tender documents and the bids submitted by the bidders must be kept confidential until the tenderer announces the results and awards the contract.

At Least One Relevant Case Law:
National Buildings Construction Corporation Ltd. v. S. Raghunathan and Co. (2019) Supreme Court of India - In this case, the Supreme Court held that the tender documents must be interpreted based on their plain and unambiguous meaning, and any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the tenderer.

Conclusion:
Tender is a crucial step in the process of entering into a contract, and it must be conducted in a fair and transparent manner. The tenderer must ensure that the tender documents are comprehensive and provide all the necessary information, and the evaluation of bids must be based on objective criteria.

Question 19
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part A (Short Notes - 20 Marks)**
Question (4 marks):
Novation

Answer:
**Answer:**
Novation refers to the substitution of a new contract for an existing one, with the intention of discharging the original contract and creating a new one. It is a common practice in business transactions and is often used as a means to modify the terms of an existing contract.

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. Intention to discharge the original contract: Novation requires the parties to have a clear intention to terminate the original contract and enter into a new one. This intention must be mutual and expressed in the novation agreement.
2. Agreement between all parties: Novation requires the consent of all parties involved in the original contract, as well as the new party who will be assuming the obligations.
3. Discharge of original contract: The original contract is terminated and replaced by the novation agreement. This is a fundamental feature of novation and distinguishes it from other methods of contract modification.
4. Creation of new contract: The novation agreement creates a new contract between the parties, with new terms and obligations. This new contract is separate and distinct from the original one.
5. Consideration: Just like any other contract, novation also requires consideration from all parties. This can be in the form of money, goods, or services.
6. Legal formalities: Novation may require certain legal formalities, such as a written agreement or registration, depending on the nature of the original contract.
7. Rights and obligations: The new party who assumes the obligations under the novation agreement also acquires the rights and benefits of the original contract.

**Relevant Case Law:**
In the case of Thirumalai Chemicals Ltd v. Union of India (2011) SC, the Supreme Court held that novation can take place either by express agreement or by implication of law. In this case, the transfer of a contract between two government entities to a private party was held to be a novation, as it was found to be the intention of the parties to discharge the original contract and create a new one.

**Conclusion:**
Novation is an important concept in contract law and is commonly used in business transactions. It allows parties to modify the terms of an existing contract, with the mutual consent of all parties involved. It is essential to have a clear intention to discharge the original contract and create a new one, and consideration must also be present. The case law mentioned above further clarifies the principles and features of novation.

Question 20
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
Does the law of contract impose any obligation on a person enjoying a non-gratuitous act of another?

Answer:
**Answer:**

Introduction:

The law of contract is a fundamental aspect of civil law, which regulates the legal relationship between parties and governs agreements between them. The Indian Contract Act, 1872 is the primary legislation governing the law of contract in India. One of the key principles of contract law is that it imposes obligations on both parties. However, the question arises whether the law of contract also imposes any obligation on a person who is enjoying a non-gratuitous act of another.

Scope of Discussion:

In this essay, we will examine the concept of non-gratuitous acts and analyze whether the law of contract imposes any obligation on a person enjoying such acts. We will also discuss the key principles and features of the law of contract in this context and refer to relevant case laws to support our arguments.

Main Content:

Non-gratuitous acts refer to actions or services that are performed by one party for the benefit of another, without any expectation of payment or reward. These acts are usually done out of a sense of moral or social obligation, rather than a legal one. In such cases, the law of contract does not impose any obligation on the person enjoying the act, as there is no contract between the parties.

However, there are certain situations where the law of contract may impose an obligation on the person enjoying a non-gratuitous act. For instance, if the person enjoying the act has expressly or impliedly promised to compensate the other party, or if the act was performed in the course of a contractual relationship, then the law of contract may impose an obligation on the person to fulfill their promise or compensate the other party.

Key Principles and Features:

The law of contract is based on the principles of offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations. The key feature of a contract is that it creates a legally binding agreement between the parties, which is enforceable by law. In cases of non-gratuitous acts, there is usually no offer, acceptance, or consideration involved, and therefore, there is no legally binding agreement between the parties.

Relevant Case Laws:

In the case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893) Court of Appeal, the court held that a promise made to the whole world, without any offer, acceptance, or consideration, can still constitute a valid contract. However, this case is an exception to the general rule and does not apply to non-gratuitous acts.

In the case of Balfour v. Balfour (1919) Court of Appeal, the court held that agreements made between spouses in a domestic relationship are not legally binding, as they lack the intention to create legal relations. This case further supports the argument that non-gratuitous acts do not impose any obligation on the person enjoying them.

Conclusion:

To conclude, the law of contract does not impose any obligation on a person enjoying a non-gratuitous act of another, unless there is a promise to compensate or a contractual relationship between the parties. The key principles of offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations are not present in such cases, and therefore, the law of contract does not apply. However, it is important to note that this is a general rule, and there may be exceptions to it, as seen in the case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.

---

In light of the above, it is evident that the law of contract does not impose any obligation on a person enjoying a non-gratuitous act of another. This principle is in line with the basic principles and features of contract law and is supported by relevant case laws. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to understand the scope and limitations of contract law in such situations to avoid any legal disputes.

Question 21
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
How are the liabilities of the party to a contract affected by supervening impossibility?

Answer:
**Answer:**

**Introduction:**
Supervening impossibility refers to a situation where the performance of a contract becomes impossible due to unforeseen and uncontrollable events. It is a defense against the enforcement of a contract and affects the liabilities of the parties involved. In India, the Indian Contract Act, 1872 deals with the concept of supervening impossibility and its effects on contracts.

**Main Content:**
1. **Definition and Concept:**
Supervening impossibility refers to an event that occurs after the formation of a contract, making it impossible for the parties to fulfill their obligations. It is not the same as initial impossibility, which refers to a situation where the contract cannot be performed at the time of its formation. Supervening impossibility is an event that could not have been foreseen or prevented by the parties.

2. **Key Principles and Features:**
a. Doctrine of Frustration: When supervening impossibility occurs, the contract is said to be frustrated, and the parties are relieved from their obligations. This doctrine is based on the principle of equity and prevents unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of the other.
b. Change in Circumstances: The event must be beyond the control of the parties and not caused by their own actions. For example, natural disasters, war, government regulations, etc.
c. Impossibility of Performance: The event must render the performance of the contract impossible, not just difficult or burdensome.
d. No Fault of Either Party: The event must not be caused by any fault or negligence of either party.

3. **Relevant Case Laws:**
a. Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur & Co. (1954) Supreme Court: In this case, the Supreme Court held that when the performance of a contract becomes impossible due to an unforeseen event, the parties are discharged from their obligations under the contract.
b. Taylor v. Caldwell (1863) Queen's Bench: In this case, the court held that if an event occurs that makes the performance of the contract impossible, the contract is automatically discharged.

4. **Critical Analysis:**
The concept of supervening impossibility is based on the principle of fairness and equity. It allows parties to be relieved from their obligations when they are unable to perform due to unforeseen events. However, it is essential to note that the event must be beyond the control of the parties and not caused by their own actions. It also does not apply to contracts where the parties have expressly agreed to bear the risk of such events.

**Current Legal Position:**
The Indian Contract Act, 1872 does not specifically mention supervening impossibility, but it is recognized and applied by courts based on the doctrine of frustration. The courts have also laid down guidelines for determining whether an event qualifies as supervening impossibility and have emphasized that the event must be truly impossible, not just difficult or expensive.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, supervening impossibility is an event that occurs after the formation of a contract, rendering its performance impossible. It affects the liabilities of the parties involved, and they are relieved from their obligations. The concept is based on the principle of equity and is recognized by courts in India. However, it is essential to meet the criteria laid down by the courts for an event to qualify as supervening impossibility.

Question 22
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
Distinguish between a wagering agreement and a contingent contract.

Answer:
**Answer:**

**Introduction:**
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates legal obligations and rights. It is essential to understand the different types of contracts to determine their validity and enforceability. Two common types of contracts are wagering agreements and contingent contracts.

**Definition and Concept:**
A wagering agreement is a contract in which two parties agree to pay each other based on the outcome of an uncertain event. In simpler terms, it is a bet where one party stands to gain or lose money depending on the result of an event. On the other hand, a contingent contract is a contract in which the performance of one or both parties is subject to the happening or non-happening of a future uncertain event.

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. Consideration: In wagering agreements, the consideration is the money or property staked by the parties. In contingent contracts, the consideration is the promise to do or not to do something upon the happening or non-happening of the event.
2. Uncertainty of the event: In wagering agreements, the event must be uncertain and out of the control of the parties. In contingent contracts, the event must be uncertain, but it can be within the control of the parties.
3. Legality: Wagering agreements are illegal and void, as they promote gambling and are against public policy. Contingent contracts, on the other hand, are valid and legal.
4. Nature of liability: In wagering agreements, the liability of the parties is contingent on the outcome of the event. In contingent contracts, the liability of the parties is conditional on the happening or non-happening of the event.
5. Enforcement: Wagering agreements are not enforceable by law, and the losing party cannot sue for the return of the money or property. Contingent contracts are enforceable, and the parties can sue for specific performance or damages.

**At Least One Relevant Case Law:**
1. Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893) Queen's Bench Division: In this case, the defendant advertised that anyone who used their smoke ball three times a day for two weeks and still contracted influenza would be paid £100. The plaintiff used the product as instructed but still caught influenza. The court held that this was a contingent contract, and the defendant was liable to pay the promised amount as the conditions were fulfilled.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, a wagering agreement is a bet based on an uncertain event, while a contingent contract is a contract based on the happening or non-happening of an uncertain event. Wagering agreements are illegal and unenforceable, while contingent contracts are valid and enforceable. It is crucial to distinguish between these two types of contracts to understand their legal implications.

Question 23
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
Describe the essential elements of contracts. When does an agreement become void?

Answer:
**Answer:**

**Introduction:**
Contracts are an important aspect of commercial law and are essential for the smooth functioning of businesses. In India, the Indian Contract Act, 1872 governs the formation and enforcement of contracts. Contracts are legally binding agreements made between two or more parties, which are enforceable by law. The essential elements of a contract are crucial for its validity and enforceability.

**Main Content:**

**Definition and Concept:**
A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties, which creates legally binding obligations between them. It is based on the principle of consensus ad idem, which means "meeting of minds". This implies that all parties must have a mutual understanding of the terms and conditions of the contract.

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. Offer and Acceptance: An offer is a proposal made by one party to another, expressing a willingness to enter into a contract. Acceptance is the unconditional agreement to the terms of the offer. Both offer and acceptance must be communicated to the other party to form a valid contract.

2. Consideration: Consideration refers to something of value given by one party to another in exchange for something else. It is an essential element of a contract and must be lawful and sufficient. It can be in the form of money, goods, services, or even a promise to do something.

3. Intention to create legal relations: For a contract to be valid, there must be an intention by the parties to create legal relations. This means that the parties must intend to be legally bound by the terms of the contract.

4. Capacity to Contract: A person must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract. This means that they must be of sound mind, of legal age, and not disqualified by law.

5. Free Consent: The consent of the parties must be free from any coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake. If the consent is obtained through any of these means, the contract becomes voidable.

**At Least One Relevant Case Law:**
A prime example of a case law that highlights the essential elements of a contract is Balfour v Balfour (1919) CA. In this case, the husband promised to pay his wife a monthly allowance while he was away working. However, the couple later separated, and the wife sued her husband for the unpaid allowances. The court held that there was no intention to create legal relations at the time the promise was made and thus, there was no valid contract.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the essential elements of a contract include offer and acceptance, consideration, intention to create legal relations, capacity to contract, and free consent. These elements are crucial for the formation and validity of a contract. Any omission or defect in these elements can render a contract void.

**When does an agreement become void?**
An agreement becomes void when it lacks any of the essential elements of a contract. It means that the agreement is not enforceable by law, and the parties are not bound by its terms. A void agreement is considered as if it never existed. Some of the instances when an agreement becomes void are:
1. Agreement with unlawful consideration or object
2. Agreement without free consent
3. Agreement with a minor or a person of unsound mind
4. Agreement made under mutual mistake of fact
5. Agreement entered into under coercion, undue influence, or fraud.

---
In the current legal position, the Indian Contract Act, 1872 recognizes various types of void agreements and provides remedies for parties who have entered into such agreements. It is essential for parties to understand the essential elements of a contract to ensure the validity and enforceability of their agreements. In case of any ambiguity, it is advisable to seek legal advice before entering into a contract.

Question 24
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
Discuss briefly the law relating to communication of offer, acceptance, and revocation.

Answer:
**Answer:**

Introduction:
The communication of offer, acceptance, and revocation is an essential aspect of contract law in India. It refers to the process of making, accepting, and withdrawing an offer in a contract. These principles are governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and form the basis of a legally binding agreement.

Main Content:
• Definition and Concept:
The communication of offer, acceptance, and revocation involves the exchange of proposals and acceptance between parties to create a valid contract. Offer is a proposal made by one party to another, while acceptance is the assent given by the offeree to the offeror. Revocation refers to the withdrawal of an offer before it is accepted.

• Key Principles and Features:
1. Offer: An offer must be communicated by the offeror to the offeree. It must be specific, definite, and certain in its terms. It can be made by words, conduct, or in writing.
2. Acceptance: The acceptance of an offer must be unconditional and in the prescribed manner. It must be communicated to the offeror and must match the terms of the offer.
3. Revocation: An offer can be revoked at any time before it is accepted, either by the offeror or by a third party with the authority to do so.

• Relevant Case Laws:
1. Lalman Shukla v. Gauri Dutt (1913) Cal: In this case, the defendant offered a reward for the safe return of his missing nephew. The plaintiff discovered the nephew and communicated it to the defendant's housekeeper. The defendant later revoked the offer and the plaintiff sued for the reward. The court held that the offer was not properly communicated to the plaintiff and therefore, he was not entitled to the reward.
2. Bhagwandas Goverdhandas Kedia v. Girdharilal Parshottamdas (1966) Bom: In this case, the defendant offered to sell goods to the plaintiff through a letter. The plaintiff accepted the offer by sending a telegram. However, the defendant did not receive the telegram due to a postal delay. The court held that the acceptance was not properly communicated and therefore, there was no valid contract.

• Critical Analysis:
The law relating to communication of offer, acceptance, and revocation is crucial in ensuring the formation of a valid contract. It provides clarity and certainty to the parties involved and prevents any misunderstanding or confusion.

• Current Legal Position:
The current legal position in India is that an offer must be properly communicated to the offeree for it to be valid. The acceptance must also be communicated in the prescribed manner and must match the terms of the offer. Revocation can be done at any time before acceptance.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the communication of offer, acceptance, and revocation is an important aspect of contract law in India. It ensures that parties are aware of the terms of the contract and agree to them before entering into an agreement. The principles and features of these concepts must be followed strictly to create a legally binding contract.

Question 25
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
Explain the term "Consideration" and state the exceptions to the rule "No Consideration, No Contract."

Answer:
**Answer:**

**Introduction:**
Consideration is one of the essential elements of a valid contract, without which a contract is not enforceable by law. It refers to the exchange of something of value between the parties to a contract. Consideration can take various forms such as money, goods, services, or even a promise to do or not to do something. In India, the Indian Contract Act, 1872, governs the principles of consideration in contracts.

**Definition and Concept:**
Consideration is defined under Section 2(d) of the Indian Contract Act as "when at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or any other person has done or abstained from doing, or does or abstains from doing, or promises to do or abstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence is called consideration for the promise." In simple terms, consideration is the price for which a promise is bought.

**Key Principles and Features:**
1. Consideration must be lawful: It should not involve any illegal or immoral act.
2. Consideration must move at the desire of the promisor: It should be given in exchange for the promise and not forced upon the promisor.
3. Consideration can be past, present, or future: It can be given before, during, or after the formation of the contract.
4. Consideration must be real and not illusory: It should have some value in the eyes of the law.
5. Consideration need not be adequate: As long as there is some consideration, the court will not inquire into the adequacy of the consideration.
6. Consideration must be sufficient: It should be capable of being valued in terms of money.

**At Least One Relevant Case Law:**
**Currie v. Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153**
In this case, the court stated that consideration can be an act, forbearance, or promise to do or not to do something. It need not be of any economic value but must be real and have some value in the eyes of the law.

**Exceptions to the Rule "No Consideration, No Contract":**
1. Contracts under seal: In such contracts, consideration is presumed to be present, and there is no need to prove it.
2. Gift: A gift is a voluntary transfer of property without any consideration.
3. Agency: In agency contracts, the consideration is not required as the agent acts on behalf of the principal.
4. Natural love and affection: In cases where parties are closely related, such as family members, consideration is not necessary.
5. Compromise or composition: When two parties agree to settle a dispute or debt, consideration is not necessary.
6. Bailment: In bailment contracts, the bailor does not provide any consideration to the bailee.
7. Completed gifts: When a gift is already completed, there is no requirement of consideration.

**Conclusion:**
Consideration is a fundamental aspect of a valid contract and must be present for a contract to be enforceable. It must be lawful, real, and of some value in the eyes of the law. However, there are some exceptions to the rule "no consideration, no contract," such as contracts under seal, gifts, and agency contracts. These exceptions are recognized by the courts to ensure justice and fairness in certain situations.

Question 26
================================================================================
Subject: 1. Contract - I
Section: **Part B (60 Marks)**
Question (12 marks):
What are the Reliefs that can be granted under the Static Relief Act?

Answer:
**Answer:**
The Specific Relief Act, 1963 is a civil law legislation that provides for specific reliefs in cases of breach of contract. The Act aims to provide speedy and effective remedies to the aggrieved party in case of breach of contract, rather than just monetary compensation. The reliefs that can be granted under the Specific Relief Act are as follows:

1. Specific Performance: This relief is granted by the court to compel the defaulting party to fulfill their contractual obligations. In other words, the court orders the party in breach to perform the contract as per its terms. This relief is usually granted in cases where monetary compensation would not adequately remedy the breach, such as in cases of unique goods or services.

2. Injunction: An injunction is a court order that prohibits a party from doing a certain act or compels them to do a certain act. This relief can be granted in cases where the breach of contract is ongoing or likely to occur in the future. For example, an injunction can be granted to stop a party from selling a property to someone else after entering into a contract to sell it to another party.

3. Rescission of Contract: Rescission is a remedy that allows the parties to a contract to cancel it and be relieved from their contractual obligations. This relief is usually granted in cases where one party has been induced to enter into the contract by fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake.

4. Rectification of Contract: Rectification is a remedy that allows the parties to a contract to correct any mistake in the contract that does not reflect their true intentions. The court can order the contract to be amended to reflect the actual agreement between the parties.

5. Declaratory Relief: Declaratory relief is a remedy that allows the court to declare the rights and obligations of the parties under a contract. This relief is granted in cases where there is a dispute regarding the interpretation of a contract.

**Relevant Case Law:**
M/s. Patel Engineering Ltd. v. UOI (2012) Delhi High Court - In this case, the court granted specific performance of a contract for construction of a dam as it was found that monetary compensation would not be an adequate remedy for the breach.

--- 
In conclusion, the Specific Relief Act provides for various remedies that can be granted in cases of breach of contract. These reliefs aim to provide the aggrieved party with a suitable remedy according to the nature of the breach. The Act plays an important role in ensuring justice and fairness in contractual relationships.
